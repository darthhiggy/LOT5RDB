Courtly samurai are expected to know dozens of classic poems by heart and grasp literary allusions that can provide important subtext in conversation. The best poets compose in the moment, with every sentence they speak layered with meaning. Haiku, a three-line poem with five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, then five in the last, is one of the most popular forms of poetry in Rokugan. Writers often use it to describe a moment in time, from the first snowflake seen in winter to a moment of tranquility by a pond. Others practice different forms of poetry, including longer poems and competitions of linked poems traded back and forth, or write prose in the form of travel diaries, philosophical essays, and even fantastical tales. Literature allows a character to create powerful compositions that sway readers and to understand the literary devices and allusions that underlie such influential works. Additionally, the aesthetics of calligraphy are important to many writers in Rokugan, so Composition also governs the act of putting words on a surface in ink in a pleasing way."

    "Text":"Presentation matters. At court, it is often said that beautiful looks reflect a beautiful soul, and also whispered that one whose soul is corrupt will display physical signs of that corruption. Despite wiser words on the subject by Shinsei and other sages, a skilled samurai who dresses shabbily will often be seen as lesser than the barely competent one who is well dressed. Design covers the act of making clothes for times of peace and formal occasions. After all, arms and armor are not appropriate for all situations in a samurai’s life, much as some individuals might lament this reality. However, that does not mean that a samurai attending court can afford to choose their garments with any less care than when they take to the battlefield. Carefully selected clothes and adornments are vital weapons and armor to courtiers, allowing them to send subtle signals to others and avoid humiliation at the hands of enemies. Thus, the creation, maintenance, and assessment of clothing is an important field of expertise, allowing a character to create and improve on items worn in many formal situations."

Many samurai go into battle wielding armor and weaponry that are stunning works of art in their own right. The finest armor and weapons—especially the daishō—are created with an eye toward both use and aesthetic, as they will be in service for centuries. They must reflect the influence and wealth of the family that owns them, for the sword is said to be the outward manifestation of the samurai’s soul. Ruling families have weapons hundreds of years old, displayed in a place of honor as a living reminder of each family’s history. The Phoenix and Crane are famous for the beauty of their work, while the Crab blades are known for durability and effectiveness. Those rare creations worked by a Kakita smith are widely acknowledged to be the greatest of all."

Lives hang in the balance, and one word can inspire victory or lead to disaster. When chaos arises, it is the duty of those in command to take charge and to instill order, and they will be the ones judged on the success or failure of the operation, not their underlings. The Command skill is used to instill obedience, whether in court or on the battlefield. It is generally most effective when used to motivate subordinates rather than peers, or in the context of a clear command structure, as it revolves around telling others what to do (and, usually, expecting them to do it)."

In the vicious world of court politics, politeness is a deadly weapon in a courtier’s arsenal. Baiting someone to an outburst of emotion can destroy their reputation and earn their enmity for life, while deflecting someone’s wrath onto oneself, taking the blame for a mistake, can put them in one’s debt and foster new alliances. Courtesy is also needed when one wishes to influence the perceived truth of a matter that may be in question, regardless of the actual truth."

As a result, success at games is one way a new arrival at court can earn distinction and get access to people of much higher rank, whom they would otherwise be unable to approach. However, only the truly naïve overlook the fact that games are merely one more means to an end in the shifting world of court politics. The games of Rokugan are as varied as the clans, but first among them is Go, a game played with black and white stones and a wooden board. Played by peasant and Emperor, young and old, bushi and monk, it can be found in all walks of life in Rokugan. The rules are simple, but mastering the game requires years of dedication; proficiency is always worthy of respect. Other games include Fortunes and Winds, a dice game many samurai see as a pastime for the lower classes; Sadane, a game of biting insults that courtiers enjoy; Karuta, a card game of trick taking using both illustrations and lines of poetry; and Shōgi, a tactical game of generals, cavalry, and assorted soldiers."

Performances of sufficient caliber can help to bridge political divides, influence people to rethink their lives, or even set off artistic or political movements. Performance is also used for impersonating others, though obviously doing so would be dishonorable. Performers occupy an unusual place in Rokugan. Commoners who practice the performing arts are treated poorly by the upper classes and are considered unworthy of the status of craftspeople or farmers. However, every court features musicians, dancers, and artists who are of common birth but are allowed to bring entertainment to those of high station. Their dishonorable status is tolerably ignored—as long as they entertain their betters. Meanwhile, samurai performers are praised by their peers for having an “expressive nature,” or a “poetic soul.”"

This includes recent goings-on, historical events, and persons of significance, as well as staying current with the fashions that hold sway over the courts of provincial lords and the Emperor. While such knowledge might seem trivial, it can allow a character to learn where to meet people of importance in a new place, how to interact comfortably with the locals, and what recent news to avoid mentioning while making pleasant conversation."

Each of these individuals must be part warlord, part courtier, and part bureaucrat, and they must act effectively in each of these spheres to maintain their rule. This encompasses a strong understanding of political machinations, a solid foundation in logistics, and a familiarity with Rokugan’s strict and sometimes arcane legal system, which favors status rather than testimony and propriety over evidence. Most daimyō keep a number of valued retainers who are experts in these fields close to them for consultation."

The Medicine skill encompasses all of these elements. Prospective healers must first understand the systems of the body, and then gain the practical knowledge of how to apply their knowledge to properly diagnose and treat their patients. Of course, some dishonorable characters use their medicinal knowledge to cause harm instead of to heal, meddling with doses to create deleterious or even deadly side effects, or selecting toxic herbs with which to poison a rival. More practical in its application than some other Scholar skills, Medicine covers knowledge of the human body and its functions. However, Medicine is also a practiced art, so it often behaves like an Artisan skill when used to heal injuries or create medicines. While any skill can operate with another skill group’s approaches, it is fairly common for the Medicine skill to do so. Thus, several examples of when it uses Artisan skill approaches are noted in the following text."

Rokugan is often called the Land of Ten Thousand Fortunes, and a proper grounding in Theology is required to know of even a portion of them. A character can use Theology to know about kami, the Fortunes, and the powers and deities associated with Shinseism and other religious traditions, as well as to make supplications to these powers. A character versed in Theology is also versed in religious history and associated knowledge, including astronomy (for the study of portents) and the related fields of metaphysics and science with mystical implications. Theology is also the skill used for most invocations— the powerful appeals to the kami that shugenja make to wield astonishing elemental powers. However, for most characters, Theology does not involve such flashy displays, dealing more in the doctrines and histories of the various spiritual traditions of Rokugan. It usually entails knowledge of rituals of philosophical and religious significance, as well as of communion with the forces of the universe on a more subtle level. Not everyone has the potential to become a shugenja—and perhaps more importantly, the shugenja schools guard their secrets jealously—so most priests in the Emerald Empire are humble keepers of the faith, serving the kami via proper veneration and performing social and religious functions for their communities. Monks, courtiers, and even bushi are also likely to study Theology, for a variety of personal and societal reasons."

Nearly all of them receive some training in use of a melee weapon, even if they prefer a weapon such as a bow. While many samurai believe sword fighting to be the most refined of martial arts, there are numerous schools that are more renowned for their use of other melee weapons. Samurai in Rokugan use the great clubs known as tetsubō, spears, naginata and other polearms, and even staves, depending on the teachings of their school and their own personal preferences. Martial Arts [Melee] covers combat with close-quarters weapons in both practice and theory."

While armor can often turn an arrow at range and it is no replacement for a melee weapon once battle lines close, the effect of a well-coordinated volley can be staggering, as each wounded warrior removes not just one enemy from the field, but any other combatants who move to retrieve them. A master archer is terrifying to behold, capable of slaying foes from considerable distances. Even humble ranged weapons, such as slings and hurled projectiles, can be quite deadly in a fight, removing combatants from the battle. On the other end of the spectrum, the Crab Clan has constructed numerous siege-scale ranged weapons meant to engage large demons and other supernatural horrors from high atop the Kaiu Wall. Martial Arts [Ranged] covers combat with thrown and projectile weapons in both practice and theory."

Some schools, however, teach it exclusively, for philosophical or practical reasons. Monks, for instance, cannot legally wield daishō, and thus are often practitioners of advanced unarmed techniques. As with other martial arts, traditions spring up and vanish frequently over the centuries, and when visiting a monastery, it is not uncommon to discover that its members practice arts rarely seen outside its walls. Martial Arts [Unarmed] covers combat with the body as one’s primary weapon in both practice and theory, as well as the use of some improvised weapons."

Martial skills are defined by struggle, and for many warriors, the greatest struggle is the one within. Meditation is the skill that covers the battles fought in one’s own mind. It is the skill used to process one’s own emotions, to recover mental control when shocked, and to resist confusion and supernatural influence of the mind. War might be a samurai’s pursuit, but a human being at war must face the steady erosion of the soul or risk succumbing completely to brutality. Most samurai train in Meditation both to ready their minds for the terrors of battle and to seek greater cosmic knowledge within themselves."

Battles are not won without casualties, and every commander spends the lives of their soldiers to achieve victory, but this does not mean that they value these lives any less. Samurai learn many arts, but the practice of war is among their core functions. While it may be true that every battle’s outcome is decided before the first soldier moves, it falls to battlefield leaders, from generals to squad sergeants, to make that outcome a reality. Tactics governs battlefield leadership, from the general’s tent to the front line. It reflects a character’s awareness of the flow of battle and their ability to both stick to their orders and seize the opportunities that arise to greatest effect. While the Command skill is used to motivate soldiers, restore morale, and maintain order, the Tactics skill is used to effectively manage troops who are already obedient.

At its heart, commerce is not about negotiating for a better price (it is unseemly to give someone less than their work is worth, after all) but of knowing how to play the market to exchange more goods for less work. To operate any sort of business successfully, a character must have at least a cursory proficiency in this skill, for without it, they are sure to see their fortunes collapse. Most samurai view money as a societal necessity, but a “dirty” one—after all, their lords provide them with the tools and equipment they require. In Rokugan, skill with money is the skill that no one values but everyone needs. Further, they see merchants as creating nothing, and so most of Rokugan puts merchants below peasants in the social order. However, in many cities, merchants are as powerful as samurai, and far wealthier."
