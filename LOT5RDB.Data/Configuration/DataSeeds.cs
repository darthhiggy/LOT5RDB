                            non-utilitarian visual art, such as bonsai (trimming

                            ikebana (flower arrangement), origami, painting,
                            and rock gardening. Such arts serve a deeply important
                            role in the courts of Rokugan, and any courtier is
                            expected to have an understanding of their principles,
                            techniques, and guiding philosophies. By understanding
                            a work of art, one can gain insight into its creator,
                            and that insight can be invaluable in pursuing political
                            agendas and court intrigue alike."

                            finer points of wordsmithing, literature is an elevated
                            art in Rokugan. Courtly samurai are expected to know
                            dozens of classic poems by heart and grasp literary
                            allusions that can provide important subtext in conversation.
                            The best poets compose in the moment, with
                            every sentence they speak layered with meaning.
                            Haiku, a three-line poem with five syllables in the first
                            line, seven in the second, then five in the last, is one of
                            the most popular forms of poetry in Rokugan. Writers
                            often use it to describe a moment in time, from the first
                            snowflake seen in winter to a moment of tranquility by a
                            pond. Others practice different forms of poetry, including
                            longer poems and competitions of linked poems
                            traded back and forth, or write prose in the form of travel
                            diaries, philosophical essays, and even fantastical tales.
                            Literature allows a character to create powerful
                            compositions that sway readers and to understand the
                            literary devices and allusions that underlie such influential
                            works. Additionally, the aesthetics of calligraphy are
                            important to many writers in Rokugan, so Composition

                            that one whose soul is corrupt will display physical
                            signs of that corruption. Despite wiser words on the
                            subject by Shinsei and other sages, a skilled samurai
                            who dresses shabbily will often be seen as lesser than
                            the barely competent one who is well dressed.
                            Design covers the act of making clothes for times of
                            peace and formal occasions. After all, arms and armor

                            much as some individuals might lament this reality.
                            However, that does not mean that a samurai attending
                            court can afford to choose their garments with any less
                            care than when they take to the battlefield. Carefully
                            selected clothes and adornments are vital weapons
                            and armor to courtiers, allowing them to send subtle
                            signals to others and avoid humiliation at the hands of
                            enemies. Thus, the creation, maintenance, and assessment
                            of clothing is an important field of expertise,
                            allowing a character to create and improve on items

                            Prospective healers must first understand the systems
                            of the body, and then gain the practical knowledge
                            of how to apply their knowledge to properly
                            diagnose and treat their patients. Of course, some dishonorable
                            characters use their medicinal knowledge to
                            cause harm instead of to heal, meddling with doses

                            in Theology is required to know of even a portion

                            usually entails knowledge of rituals of philosophical

                            the forces of the universe on a more subtle level. Not
                            everyone has the potential to become a shugenja—and

                            and even bushi are also likely to study Theology,

                            by the ruling class for the mastery they achieve. Those
                            skilled in labor are those who know the most efficient
                            ways of performing their duties, as well as how to effectively
                            use the tools of their trade."

                            such as salt come from the sea. Further, despite
                            Rokugan’s inhospitable policy toward foreigners, foreign
                            trade does occur in numerous port cities, both

                            thousand odd jobs, and they must understand how

                            trade alike. Grain, tea, sake, logs, mineral wealth, and
                            other supplies are often moved from city to city by river,
                            or to the coast where larger ships move them to
                            major ports. An expert seafarer can be the difference
                            between a force arriving on time for a battle or a day
                            behind, and keeping those armies fed."
